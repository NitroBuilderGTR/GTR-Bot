# GTR-Bot

This is a Discord Bot that You can easily Modify, with your own Needs.

Feel free to use it, and create your own Bots with this code!

It was built mainly with C# I used Discord.Net, as the Bot API / type. 

# How to Modify

Make a C# Project, and then get Discord.Net installed. 

I use Visual Studio 2019, and do the following, 

1) Create a New Project, make it a C# Console Application, in .Net Framework.

2) Go to "Manage NuGet Packages".

3) Then search for "Discord.Net" click on The first result, and install. 

4) Now just copy and paste my "Program.cs" content into your own Program.cs file. Feel free to Modify it to your own needs.

5) Then, Create a new Folder. Call it Modules.

6) After you have created the Modules Folder, Create a new Class File, with the "Class File" file type, and call it Commands.cs

7) Copy and paste my Commands.cs file, and modify it to your own needs.

And, your done!
